Python Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections that are indexed by keys, 
which can be any immutable type. It is best to think of a 
dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with 
the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). 
Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within braces adds 
initial key:value pairs to the dictionary.
